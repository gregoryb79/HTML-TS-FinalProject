Module 2 Final Project.

This application is a patients site "iPatient", where a patient can see his information (appointments, perscriptions, test), and make new appointments to various doctors and tests.

On start, the patient is requested to put his ID and phone nummber (as password).
There is a registration form - where a new patient can "create" itself.

On start the application loads from csv files some mock-up data, also on patients.

The recomended Patient ID for presentation is: 255888158 - he has a lot of tests, appointments and prescriptions.
